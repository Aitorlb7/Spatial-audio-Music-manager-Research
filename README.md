## About this project

Spatial audio and Music manager research with SDL_Mixer.

On this research I prepared a code structure in C++, to play fx and audio spatially and chain a playlist with fading to swap between any desired music stored in a list. With a small graphical representation.

You can download the release [here](https://github.com/Aitorlb7/Spatial-audio-Music-manager-Research/releases/tag/1.0). It contains all the TODO's inside the exercises folder, and the full code with the solutions.
